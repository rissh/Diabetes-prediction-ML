# Diabetes Prediction Project

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project! This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related features. Early detection of diabetes is crucial for effective management and improved health outcomes.

## Overview

- **Dataset:** [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the project code.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-project.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Explore the Notebooks:**
    - Start with `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb` for an in-depth analysis.
    - Move on to `Model_Training_and_Evaluation.ipynb` to see the model development process.

4. **Run the Notebooks:**
    - Open the notebooks using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
    - Execute the cells to reproduce the analysis and model training.

## Visualizations

Explore various visualizations in the `images/` directory, showcasing the dataset's characteristics and model performance.


## Next Steps

- **Model Deployment:** If applicable, consider deploying the trained model for practical use.
- **Contributions:** Contributions and suggestions are welcome. Fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request.
